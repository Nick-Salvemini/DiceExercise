        <p>Players take turns rolling a single six-sided die and placing it on their side of the board. Each player has
            their own 3x3 grid, and their score is the total of all the dice currently placed there. When one player has
            filled all nine slots on their board, the game ends, and the player with the highest score wins.
            <br>Each player's grid is divided into three columns. If a player has two or three dice showing the same
            number
            in a single column, their values are added together and multiplied by the number of matches.
        </p>
        <div><img src="/howToPlayImgs/KB-NumChart.png" alt=""></div>


        <p>If a player places a die that matches one or more dice in their opponent's corresponding column, all of their
            opponent's matching dice are removed. This allows you to get rid of high-scoring dice, even doubles or
            triples, as long as you have somewhere for your matching die to go. While the game is luck-based, being
            strategic with your die placement is the best way to win consistently.
